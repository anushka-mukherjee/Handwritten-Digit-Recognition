# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project recognize human handwritten digits.
To implement this application, I found out about the MNIST database (a large database of handwritten digits), which I could use in my application. I was especially interested in how machines interpret images, which is what made me decide to work on this project. The idea was to first build and train the neural network for effective image classification purposes. Then, there would be a GUI where the user could draw a digit on the canvas. This digit would then be classified, and the result would be displayed.

This project was a huge learning curve for me. Researching which libraries to use was the hardest part, but studying online APIs helped me build an application where the image of a handwritten digit was correctly classified and the result was displayed.
